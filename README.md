## Greetings

Hi This is Camilo, to use this project please clone it and create a .env file, you can copy the .env.example file

Then put in your .env file a x_api_key

The x_api_key is the key that your application will use to prevent people to access without it

Then modify the database info and set your database credentials

Then in console run php artisan migrate:fresh --seed, to set the default data for your database

The default frontend for this project is in this repo: https://github.com/shakamanaka/football.

Hope you enjoy it!

Laravel Lumen is a stunningly fast PHP micro-framework for building web applications with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Lumen attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as routing, database abstraction, queueing, and caching.
